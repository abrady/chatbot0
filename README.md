Streaming Chat UI (no bells, just vibes)
Goal: A minimal chat app that streams tokens as they arrive.

You’ll build:

/api/chat route that proxies to a model and streams Server‑Sent Events (SSE).

React chat box that renders streaming text incrementally.
Stretch: Add “system” vs “user” prompts, temperature slider, and a token meter.
